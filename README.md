# Root Cause Analysis for vehicle product quality with Snowflake

## Overview


In the modern automotive industry, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) typically manage their data using a hybrid cloud approach. For example, connected mobility data, including vehicle and telematics information, might be stored in AWS US-West-2, while parts manufacturing data resides in GCP US-Central-1. Meanwhile, supplier quality data may be housed in another cloud or region, such as Azure US-West-2. This specific cloud and region variation is just an example, but the underlying strategy is clear: to prevent over-dependence on any one particular public cloud vendor. However, this multi-cloud approach introduces several challenges, particularly when it comes to conducting a Vehicle Quality Root Cause Analysis (RCA). 

The Cross-region data sharing from Snowflake offers a robust solution to the multi-cloud challenges by providing a unified, scalable, and secure data platform. By centralizing data storage and processing in Snowflake, OEMs can streamline the RCA process, enhance collaboration, and derive meaningful insights, ultimately leading to better decision-making and improved vehicle quality.
